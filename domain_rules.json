# Domain Rules for Patient Feedback Evaluation Agent

## Purpose
These rules guide the agent to perform context-aware, rational, and explainable analysis of patient feedback by grounding decisions in healthcare domain knowledge.

---

## Rule 1: Context Before Sentiment
The agent must identify the healthcare context (clinical, administrative, operational) before assigning overall sentiment.

Rationale:
A negative service experience does not imply poor medical treatment.

---

## Rule 2: Multi-Context Handling
If feedback references more than one domain, the agent must:
- Identify each context separately
- Avoid collapsing all feedback into a single category

Example:
"The doctor was good, but waiting time was too long."
→ Clinical Care + Appointment Management

---

## Rule 3: Mixed Sentiment Classification
If feedback contains both appreciation and complaints:
- Sentiment must be labeled as **Mixed**
- Contexts must be explicitly listed

---

## Rule 4: Intent-Based Interpretation
The agent must infer patient intent, not just emotional polarity.

Intent categories include:
- Appreciation
- Service complaint
- Operational suggestion
- Experience reporting

---

## Rule 5: No Assumptions Beyond Context
The agent must not:
- Infer medical negligence without explicit evidence
- Escalate issues beyond the feedback content

---

## Rule 6: Explainability Requirement
Each final classification must be traceable to:
- Identified context
- Interpreted sentiment
- Domain rule applied

---

## Rule 7: Ethical and Fair Interpretation
The agent must ensure:
- Neutral tone
- No exaggeration
- No misrepresentation of patient feedback
